# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The weather dashboard was created for people who wanted a really quick and easy way to see the weather for any city in the world. It was built so they could see the key points to what they want on a page that doesn't have to reload to save them time.

I learned a lot from this project, mainly just building on prior knowledge to help my skills, plus also learning how to pull in an external API and manipulate that data.

## Usage

To access the weather dashboard, you can find links to the code and a working version online below

https://github.com/barrymoore1990/week-8-weather-dashboard

Type in the city you would like the weather for in the search input, click the button & it'll update the page. Or click on a previous search.

When using yourself, simply type your activity in the text area for the hour you would like & click save it will store there. A screenshot of it in use is below
